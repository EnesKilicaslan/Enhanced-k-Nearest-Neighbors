# Enhanced-k-Nearest-Neighbors

This is an implementation of enhanced k-nearest neighbors algorithm for multi-labeled documents




### ToDo List

- [ ] read necessary metarials to understand the concept

- [ ] pre-processing code ( order might change for this task )

- [ ] implement BM25 similarity to compare two documents

- [ ] implement k-NN

- [ ] implement weighted vote scheme

- [ ] implement thresholding strategy

- [ ] use inverted index to make make k-NN faster

- [ ] running the implementation on the datasets and comparing results

- [ ] changing the implementation to multi-threaded ( this task might not be done on time )

- [ ] writing report explaining what and how  I did
