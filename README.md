# Enhanced-k-Nearest-Neighbors


### ToDo List


- [ ] pre-processing code ( order might change for this task)

- [ ] BM25 similarity to compare two documents

- [ ] implement k-NN

- [ ] implement weighted vote scheme

- [ ] implement thresholding strategy

- [ ] use inverted index to make make k-NN faster

- [ ] running the implementation on the datasets and comparing results

- [ ] changing the implementation to multi-threaded
