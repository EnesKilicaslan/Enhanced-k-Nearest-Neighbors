# Enhanced-k-Nearest-Neighbors

This is an implementation of enhanced k-nearest neighbors algorithm for multi-labeled documents




### ToDo List

- [x] read necessary metarials to understand the concept

- [x] pre-processing code ( order might change for this task )

- [x] implement BM25 similarity to compare two documents

- [x] implement k-NN

- [x] implement weighted vote scheme

- [x] implement thresholding strategy

- [x] add --help command 

- [ ] write documentation

- [ ] use inverted index to make k-NN faster

- [ ] running the implementation on the datasets and comparing results

- [ ] changing the implementation to multi-threaded

- [ ] writing report explaining what and how  I did
